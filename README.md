# MyReads Project

This is my final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. It's a library app where you can keep track of books you are reading, want to read, or have read by placing them on and moving them between different bookshelves. You can search for new books and add them to your shelves.

## How to run

* install dependencies with `npm install`
* start the server with `npm start`
